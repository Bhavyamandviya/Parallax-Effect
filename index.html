                Mountain adventures are outdoor experiences that take place in mountainous terrain, such as hiking, rock
                climbing,
                mountaineering, and skiing. These activities offer scenic views, challenging physical exertion, and a
                connection to n

                Mountain adventures with snow can include activities such as skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, ice
                climbing, sledding,
                and snowmobiling. These activities take place in winter months on mountains that receive enough
                snowfall. The aim of
                these adventures is to enjoy the beautiful winter landscapes, engage in physically and mentally
                challenging activities,
                and build memories with friends and family.

                Up until his retirement from Test cricket in August 2019, for nearly 15 years Steyn was arguably one of
                South Africa's
                and the world's greatest Test bowlers since his debut in 2004 and frequently dominated the top spot in
                the MRF Tyres ICC
                Test Bowling Rankings. He is the leading wicket-taker for South Africa in Tests, having surpassed Shaun
                Pollock in
                December 2018; Steyn has 439 scalps to his name in 93 matches, at a remarkable average of 22.95 with 26
                five-wicket
                hauls.
                <br>
                <br>
                Steyn claimed his career-best figures in Nagpur with a devastating spell of reverse-swing bowling,
                defying alien
                conditions as South Africa completed victory by an innings and six runs in the series opener. India,
                previously unbeaten
                under MS Dhoni's leadership, were skittled for 233 on a surface good enough for South Africa to rack up
                558/6 in the
                first innings. His scalps included Murali Vijay and Sachin Tendulkar, and the Proteas claimed a lead big
                enough to
                enforce the follow on. Dhoni was unbeaten no longer.

                Dale Steyn made his One Day International debut on 17 August 2005 against Asia XI and later made his
                South Africa debut
                against Australia at Melbourne on 20 January 2006. And just like his Test debut, his insipid performance
                led to a quick
                axing from the team.
                Steyn picked up 196 wickets in 125 One Day Internationals at an average of 25.95. At a time when bowlers
                were at
                batsmen's mercy, Steyn's economy rate was a mere 4.87 runs per over.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside thriving in Test cricket, Dale Steyn made a significant mark in white-ball cricket as well.
                Across all formats, Dale Steyn picked up 699 international wickets in 342 innings at an average of 23.37
                runs per wicket
                and a strike rate of 37.02 balls per wicket. Steyn finishes as the 15th most prolific bowler of all
                time, but the
                batsmen who faced him and were at the receiving end of Steyn's wrath with the ball would agree that when
                in rhythm,
                there was probably no one better, more lethal than Dale Steyn.
